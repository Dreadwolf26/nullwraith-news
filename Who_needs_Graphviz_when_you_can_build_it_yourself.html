      <h3>AWS to bare metal two years later: Answering your questions about leaving AWS</h3>

The OneUptime article, AWS to Bare Metal Two Years Later, revisits the company's highly debated decision to migrate away from Amazon Web Services to a bare metal infrastructure. This reflection, two years removed from the initial switch, offers a candid assessment of the benefits, challenges, and overall impact on the company. It delves into the economic realities – exploring cost savings versus the inherent complexities and overhead associated with managing their own hardware. The piece goes beyond simple justification, presenting a data-driven analysis of latency improvements, performance gains, and the impact on developer workflows.

For developers, this case study provides a crucial counter-narrative to the pervasive cloud-first dogma. It challenges the assumption that cloud solutions are always the optimal choice, forcing a re-evaluation of the trade-offs between managed services and direct hardware control. The article highlights the importance of understanding the specific performance characteristics and cost structures of your application, and tailoring the infrastructure to meet those needs, rather than blindly adopting the latest buzzword-compliant solution. It's a reminder that infrastructure decisions should be driven by rigorous analysis and concrete business goals, not just perceived scalability or ease of use.

A key takeaway is the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of your application's unique resource demands. OneUptime's experience underscores that one size fits all infrastructure solutions, even those from leading cloud providers, can be suboptimal. By meticulously tracking performance metrics and thoroughly analyzing cost structures, development teams can identify opportunities to optimize their infrastructure, potentially leading to significant cost savings and performance improvements, even if that means swimming against the current of mainstream cloud adoption.
